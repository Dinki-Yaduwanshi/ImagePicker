# The IMAGE-PICKER APP
I used two open-source projects to create an easy and customizable way to pick images in Android apps. It can save you time and be a starting point for your own app. You can create a profile activity along with coverImage such that they give user freedom to choose and set pictures by accessing gallery and camera along with bunch of features . Here's a summarized list of what it offers.

1. Easy to Use: You can quickly add image picking to your app.
2. Make it Yours: You can change how it looks and works to match your app's style.
3. Open Source: It's built from open-source projects, so you can trust it, and the community can help.

## ðŸŽ¨Customization

**If you want to get the activity result:**


**Java**

```java
ActivityResultLauncher<Intent> launcher=
        registerForActivityResult(new ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult(),(ActivityResult result)->{
        if(result.getResultCode()==RESULT_OK){
        Uri uri=result.getData().getData();
        // Use the uri to load the image
        }else if(result.getResultCode()==ImagePicker.RESULT_ERROR){
        // Use ImagePicker.Companion.getError(result.getData()) to show an error
        }
        });
```

**Both Camera and Gallery:**

```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
    //...
    .provider(ImageProvider.BOTH) //Or bothCameraGallery()
    .createIntentFromDialog { launcher.launch(it) }
```

**Crop image:**

```kotlin
    .crop()
```

**Crop image with 16:9 aspect ratio:**

```kotlin
    .crop(16f, 9f)
```

**Crop square image(e.g for profile):**

```kotlin
    .cropSquare()    //Crop square image, its same as crop(1f, 1f)
```

**Oval crop image:**

```kotlin
    .crop()
    .cropOval() //Allow dimmed layer to have a circle inside
```

**Set Max Width and Height of final image:**

```kotlin
    .maxResultSize(512, 512, true) //true: Keep Ratio
```

**Java sample for using `createIntentFromDialog`:**

```java
ImagePicker.Companion.with(this) //use the activity.this
        .crop()
        .cropOval()
        .maxResultSize(512,512,true)
        .provider(ImageProvider.BOTH) //Or bothCameraGallery()
        .createIntentFromDialog((Function1)(new Function1(){
public Object invoke(Object var1){
        this.invoke((Intent)var1);
        return Unit.INSTANCE;
        }

public final void invoke(@NotNull Intent it){
        Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter(it,"it");
        launcher.launch(it);
        }
        }));
```

**If you want just one option(camera or gallery):**

```kotlin
    launcher.launch(
       ImagePicker.with(this)
           //...
           .cameraOnly() // or galleryOnly()
           .createIntent()
    )
```




**Let the user to pick multiple files or single file in gallery mode:**

```kotlin
        .setMultipleAllowed(true)
```

**Let the user defines the output format:**

```kotlin
        .setOutputFormat(Bitmap.CompressFormat.WEBP)
```

**Intercept ImageProvider; could be used for analytics purposes:**

```kotlin
ImagePicker.with(this)
        .setImageProviderInterceptor { imageProvider -> //Intercept ImageProvider
            Log.d("ImagePicker", "Selected ImageProvider: "+imageProvider.name)
        }
        .createIntent()
```

**Intercept Dialog dismiss event:**

```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
    	.setDismissListener {
    		// Handle dismiss event
    		Log.d("ImagePicker", "onDismiss");
    	}
    	.createIntent()
```

**Limit MIME types while choosing a gallery image:**

```kotlin
        .galleryMimeTypes(  //Exclude gif images
                    mimeTypes = arrayOf(
                      "image/png",
                      "image/jpg",
                      "image/jpeg"
                    )
                  )
```

**Add Following parameters in your **colors.xml** file, if you want to customize uCrop Activity:**
